Guzzle supports Computing environments on the AWS Cloud. In Guzzle AWS cloud setup, we can use Databricks to execute our workloads. This article helps in using AWS Databricks as a computing environment in Guzzle.

## Use of AWS Databricks as a computing environment

|Cluster type| There are 2 types of Databricks clusters available in Guzzle:<br/><br/> Data Engineering : Data engineering cluster is recommended for automated workloads. It is recommended to use it for your BAU data loads.<br/><br/> Data Analytics : Data analytics cluster is recommended for interactive queries along with concurrent user support. This cluster type is configurable in Guzzle, and it can also execute the workloads, but it is not recommended to use it for your BAU data loads. Data Analytics cluster is costlier than Data Engineering cluster for per DBU usage and meant for interactive queries through Databricks notebook in a shared environment where multiple people have to collaborate as a team. |Data Engineering|True|

|Instance profile| Instance profile is used to securely access AWS resources without using AWS keys. [Click here](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/instance-profiles.html) for more information about how to create and configure instance profiles. Once you have created an instance profile, you can select it in the Instance Profile drop-down list. Make sure your instance profile has permission to access the guzzle config storage and secret manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |None|Yes|

|Enable local storage auto-scaling| If you don’t want to allocate a fixed number of EBS volumes at cluster creation time, use autoscaling local storage. When worker begins to run too low on disk, it automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |False|No|
|EBS volume type (applicable when local storage auto-scaling is disabled)| For instance types that do not have a local disk, or if you want to increase your Spark shuffle storage space, you can specify additional EBS volumes. Consider the 'Enable local storage auto-scaling' option if you are not sure how to size them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |None|No|

|Customize environment variables| Used to specify environment variables to use in spark computes.<br/> Ex: Variable : MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.<br/> Value    : VARIABLE_VALUE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |None|
|Init script| Configure cluster node initialization or init-script that is a shell script that runs during startup for each cluster node before the Spark driver or worker JVM starts. You can use init scripts to install packages and libraries not included in the Databricks runtime, modify the JVM system classpath, set system properties and environment variables used by the JVM, or modify Spark configuration parameters, among other configuration tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |None|
|Custom cluster tags| Cluster tags allow you to easily monitor the cost of cloud resources used by various groups in your organization. You can specify tags as key-value pairs, it applies to cluster and its cloud resources like VMs and disk volumes, as well as DBU usage reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |None|
